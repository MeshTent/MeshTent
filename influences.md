## Cultural Influences & Acknowledgement

MeshTent draws deep inspiration from traditional collapsible shelter frameworks such as the *khana* lattice walls found in Mongolian yurts and Central Asian gers. These structures are an elegant combination of strength, breathability, and portabilityâ€”a technology shaped by generations of cultural knowledge.

We recognize and respect these contributions as part of our collective architectural heritage, and we support their acknowledgment as intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO and similar bodies.

MeshTent seeks to extend these traditions with ecological materials and ethical intent, never to profit from these traditions but to stand upon their shoulders in the spirit of reciprocity.
