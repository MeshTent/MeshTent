# MeshTent

**MeshTent** is a collapsible trellis exoskeleton shelter system designed for festivals, camping, and humanitarian response. It blends sustainable materials with cultural legacy and open-source values.

## 💡 Vision
To create dignified, durable, and environmentally responsible shelter that is easy to transport, assemble, and repurpose—while honoring global traditions and supporting those most in need.

## 🧵 Cultural Heritage
This design is inspired by the trellis frameworks found in Mongolian yurts and Central Asian gers. These brilliant architectures have guided this project’s core concept. We acknowledge and celebrate them as part of the world's intangible cultural heritage.

## ♻️ Materials
- Hazel or bamboo trellis lattice
- Optional stainless or aluminum mesh exoskeleton
- Recycled textiles or weatherproof fabrics
